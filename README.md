# React Concepts Demos

This repository is a collection of demonstrations on various React concepts. Each concept is illustrated with a dedicated page, making it easy to focus on one topic at a time. If you're looking to understand core React features with simple, isolated examples, this repository is for you!

## Concepts Covered

- **useEffect**: Delve into side effects in functional components and see how React's `useEffect` hook can help manage them.
  
- **useContext**: Explore the React Context API, a powerful feature that allows you to share global state and functionalities across components without prop-drilling.

- **useReducer**: Understand complex state management in components using the `useReducer` hook. Great for scenarios where `useState` just doesn't cut it.

- **Portals**: Learn about React Portals and how they can be used to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
